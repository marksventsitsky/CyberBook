### It is a unique metaverse in which not only the game process is integrated, but also the economic component and media space are.
#### The gameplay will feature PVP battles, land grabs (where you can place your buildings and monetize them later), raids of unfriendly factions, and raids on lands captured by other players. One of the unique systems is the mining of early-home cryptocurrency on captured or purchased land. In the future, you can sell tokens or experience a unique new token crafting system where by crossing two or more types of tokens there is a chance to get a more expensive token up to Eth and Btc.
