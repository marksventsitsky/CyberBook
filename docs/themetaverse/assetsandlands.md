# Assets and lands

#### Assets & Land are blockchain-based virtual tokens (using the Binance Smart Chain blockchain) representing the physical parcels and objects of the CYBEROMENS metaverse.  This allows users to own a part of the metaverse and thus be able to post content (examples are paying for public transport, participating in mini-games, going to cinemas, betting at betting companies, etc.).
#### The CYBEROMENS Metaverse is based on a map of fixed amounts of EARTH (scarce).  EARTHS are physical spaces in the Metaverse owned by players to create and monetize any kind of activity (free or paid).  Each piece of land comes with a set of pre-made terrains, but it can be transformed and modified by the user who owns it (or other users they invite to work on it).
#### Users can buy lands and further monetize them and mine random tokens there depending on the level of the land.
#### In the future, users will be able to merge EARTH together to form CITIES.  In the future, CITIES may be owned by multiple users to form DISTRICTS.
