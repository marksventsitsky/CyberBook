#### An avatar is a virtual character representing the user in the CYBEROMENS metaverse.  Each avatar comes with ready-made sets of appearance and animation, but can be changed later by the user.  The avatar will also change in parts (head, arms, body, legs, etc.), equipping it with various pieces of equipment, allows users to create their own unique avatar to distinguish themselves from other users in the CYBEROMENS metaverse.
